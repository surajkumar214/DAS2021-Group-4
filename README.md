# DAS2021-Group-4
Stage 1. 
Analyse the allocated data set using GitHub to share and store code
The document “Datasets Descriptions” on the DAS Moodle page describes 28 datasets from which each group has been allocated one to work on for this assignment (the group number corresponds to the dataset allocated). Please ensure you are working with the correct dataset and are answering
your assigned question of interest. The data sets are available to download from Moodle. Analyse the data in a collaborative fashion in a file called Group_##_Analysis.Rmd in GitHub by creating a repository on GitHub named DAS2021-Group-## where ## corresponds to the number of
your group. Only one person will need to create the repository, then add everyone else. Please also add Craig and Mitchum to your repository by Tuesday 13th July at 12:00 using the GitHub usernames craigalexander and mitchumbock. 

When using your repository for analysis, make sure to leave detailed comments on any commits you make to the main branch.
• Be sure to fork at least one piece of work out of the main branch. Assign members of your group to review the changes and then approve them.
• You will be asked to peer review relevant group members contributions to the repository, in terms of checking code, providing helpful commit messages and approving merges with detailed comments.
• If you choose to save output on your repository, please put these in a folder with an appropriate title (e.g. Plots).
