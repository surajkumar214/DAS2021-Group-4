The society is composed of one family, and the study of the population of family members is of great significance to the population of the study area. Understanding the influencing factors that affect the number of households is helpful to understand the population situation in the area, predict future population development trends and make timely policy adjustments. Datasets comes from the FIES (Family Income and Expenditure Survey) recorded in the Philippines.


A poisson GLM has been fitted for Number.of.family.members vs following covariates:-

 5. Future extension. 
 
Challenges faced:-
 1. Presence of interactions and multicolinearity among variables. 
 2. Underdispersion of residual variance.  
 3. Got some pattern in Deviance residuals vs Predicted values plot. 
 4. Presence of many influential points.
